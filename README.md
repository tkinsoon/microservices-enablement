# Welcome to Microservices Enablement

The Microservices Enablement Training Programme comes with the Lab Guide to give you further practical experience in creating docker image, deploying the application in microservices, and also setting up the kubernete cluster with PKS.

## Lab 0 - Prerequisites

This lab will walk you through setting up a jumpbox in your GCP project. 
We created a GCP project for you and at this point you hopefully have the information from your instructor, if not, please ask.

## Lab 1 - Docker 101

This lab walks you through creating a docker image followed by running the container on your local machine

## Lab 2 - Kubernetes 101

This lab walks you through deploying the container(s) with the created image to the Kubernetes cluster

## Lab 3 - PKS 101

This lab consists of **TWO** parts: Part I provides you the steps to setup your PKS on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Once the setup is done, you will need to create a new PKS clsuter in Part II, and deploy the container(s) to the newly created cluster (same as Lab 2)
